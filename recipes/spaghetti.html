        <p>Putting a little more effort in your spaghetti can go a long way!</p>
        <p>Use this recipe to step up from just heating up jar sauce</p>
        <p>Jacob taught me this and I think I'm writing it down correctly</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>A package of noodles</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (not rolled)</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 cup Cooking wine</li>
            <li>1 cup Beef broth</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Italian Seasoning/Oregano</li>
                <li>Fennel Seads (be careful!)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large sauce pan at medium high heat</li>
            <li>Add red pepper flakes and garlic cloves and stir for 1 minutes</li>
            <li>Add ground beef to skillet as a block</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add salt to top and let it sit for a minute</li>
                <li>Chop up and brown</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the beef is browned, add the jar of sauce</li>
            <li>Add wine and broth</li>
            <li>Reduce heat until sauce is consistently simmering</li>
            <li>At this point, fill a large pot with water and start to boil it</li>
            <li>Add italian seasonings and stir</li>
            <li>Mostly cover with lid, leaving a crack to simmer and reduce liquid until sauce is back to its thick texture</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering and the water in the pot is boiling, add noodles and follow instructions on package</li>
            <li>When noodles are done, add a cup of noodle water to the sauce and reduce that, too</li>
            <li>Drain noodles in a colander while running cold water over them</li>
            <li>When the sauce is reduced sufficiently, add noodles to sauce and stir</li>
            <li>The sauce should stick to the noodles</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
